## What and Why?

CodeTracker is a project aimed at creating a personal website tailored for Computer Science and Software Engineering students and professionals. The primary objectives of this website are to enable users to create profiles and connect to their Github and LeetCode accounts. This integration will facilitate the display of important information such as commit statistics, question completions, and repository language usage in their dashboard. Users can also showcase their personal coding projects on the website. The project addresses the need to centralize scattered information from various CS platforms into one unified website. It serves the dual purpose of aiding self-assessment and enhancing recruitment opportunities.

## For Whom?

- Computer Science and Software Engineering Students/Professionals

## How?

### Profile:

- Users will be able to create an account using their email address and password. 
- Users can upload a profile picture.
- Users can create an "About Me" section to introduce themselves and highlight their professional aspirations.
- Users can show their skills and previous experiences in the field.

### Dashboard:

- GitHub Integration: Users can connect their Github accounts to the platform. This integration will enable the website to fetch data, such as the number of commits per day/week/year, and display it using data visualization graphics. This provides a visual representation of their coding activity, as well as statistics on the programming languages used in the user's repositories.

- LeetCode Integration: Users can link their LeetCode accounts to the platform, enabling the retrieval of information on the number of questions completed and their difficulty levels. This data will also be presented through data visualization graphics.

### Projects:

- Users can showcase their personal coding projects on the website. To add a project, they need to submit a Github link to the project repository. The platform will automatically fetch project information and display it on the user's profile.

## Scope

The scope of the project is feasible for a group to complete within a semester. It includes the following key components:

- Secure Login System
- Database Management
- Profile Creation/Functionality 
- API Integration
- Project Showcase Feature

This scope ensures that the project remains challenging and yet achievable within a semester.
